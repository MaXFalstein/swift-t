Swift/T is an implicitly parallel programming language for composing external functions and command-line executables into massively parallel applications.  The external functions may be calls to external programs, libraries, or scripting languages (via embedded interpreters)  Thus, it is a _workflow language_ for

Swift/T runs as an MPI program, and is compatible with Cray and Blue Gene supercomputers, as well as PBS or SLURM clusters, and can also run on a laptop (Linux or Mac).

The Swift/T user guide and prepackaged distributions are available online at
the Swift/T homepage: http://swift-lang.org/Swift-T .  We recommend
that you start there if you are new to Swift or Swift/T.

Swift/T may be installed following one of these methods:
* Debian (Ubuntu) packages (recommended)
* A +configure+/+make+ source build (recommended for exotic systems)
* A script that automates the +configure+/+make+ process (recommended)
