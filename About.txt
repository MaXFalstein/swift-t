= STC Docs: About.txt

First, make a soft link in this directory to swift.css, found at:
https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/exm/www/css

To build and install everything, run:

./install-stc-docs.zsh

You may need to modify this file to include your user name.
Currently, only Wozniak has permissions on this MCS directory.

To just generate HTML, simply run:

./make-stc-docs.zsh

For the gallery, use:

./build.sh gallery.html

You can preview the HTML locally in your browser before committing.

To just build the examples tarball, run

./make-examples-tgz.zsh

To just build the gallery tarball, run

./make-gallery-tgz.zsh

You can clean up the asciidoc-generated HTML and images with ./clean-html.sh

The examples directories contain clean.sh scripts for cleanup.  These
may be used before TGZ generation or SVN operations.

To just build the simple docs, see build.sh/build.mk .
